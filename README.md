# WebServer + RestServer

# Note

Hello Im Ivan, this is teh REST API Server that I Created before, Im a movile apps developer too so I use this server to test some apps the I made, this API emulates a Cafe or a Store that has Users with roles and Products with categorys.

We can use this API to create users and products, the roles that we have for users are:
1 'ADMIN_ROLE'
2 'USER_ROLE'

For products you need first to create a category, is similar to create a user, you'll need the token.

Remember, you need to create a user or login, with a email and a password, after that you will get a "Token", this token is necessary to use the POST, DELETE and PUT endpoints.

This is the documentation of my API to get teh exmaples and detailed instructions about how to use it.

Remember to run the coman "npm install" before you run the program with "npm start".

For execute the API you can use Postman, all the data is saved in a cluster that I have in mongodb.com, if you cant test de API because postman cant reach teh database, contact me to i.teran60@gmail.com to turn on the cluster again.
